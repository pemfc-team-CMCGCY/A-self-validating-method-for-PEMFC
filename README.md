# A-self-validating-methodology-for-PEMFC
We describe the self-validating methodology using three different mathematical models: semi-empirical (SE), macro-homogeneous (MH), and singularly perturbed reaction–convection–diffusion (SP-RCD). The set of linked parameter estimation problems, solved by a Estimation of Distribution Algorithm called the UMDA^G.
